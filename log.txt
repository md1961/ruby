schema_browser/schezer.rb
(class ColumnSchema)
- Extracted helper type?() from hard_to_sort?(), and added
  too_long_to_display?().
(class TableData)
- Added LENGTH_TRUNCATE_FOR_LONG_TEXT and MARK_TRUNCATED.
- Corrected to_s_row_values() not to display BLOB type data and
  to truncate TEXT type data.
- Fixed helper compare_rows() to nil-check the values before comparison
  treat it as a minimum value if nil.
- Fixed to_s() to use to_s_row_values().
(class Schezer)
- Fixed helper output_table_data() to receive additional argument
  table_names2, and output table existence differences and data differences
  for common tables if @conn2 was non-nil.  Also modified not to output
  tables with identical records.
- Changed helper print_rows_only_in_either() into to_s_rows_only_in_either()
  which returned an array of String's to output instead of outputting them.
