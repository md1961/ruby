schema_browser/schezer.rb
(class Schezer)
- Modified initialize() to exit if @config_name_2 && @conn2.nil? as well.
- Modified helper compare_table_names_and_print() (former compare_table_names())
  to receive table names as arguments instead of making them inside.
- Made command 'regexp' to take two environments to compare.
- Corrected command 'raw' not to allow two environments.
- Fixed to_s() to call non_empty_string() with the class name.
- Added helper get_table_names_with_regexp().
- Fixed helper configure() to return nil if failed to get hash_conf.
