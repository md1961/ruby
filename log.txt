schema_browser/schezer.rb
(class TableSchemaDifference)
- Modified initialize() to prepare @schema1 and @schema2.
- Added equals?(), column_names_equals?() and primary_keys_equals?().
- Altered helper get_column_names_diff() not to receive arguments.
(class Schezer)
- Corrected helper compare_table_schemas_and_print() to use
  TableSchemaDifference#equals?() to judge if next the loop when
  @verbose was false.
