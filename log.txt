schema_browser/schezer.rb
(class TableSchema)
- Modified initialize() to receive argument raw_schema and
  capitalizes_types (default of false), and call parse_raw_schema()
  with those.
- Changed parse_raw_schema() to a private method.
(class ColumnSchema)
- Added hard_to_sort?() along with TYPES_HARD_TO_SORT.
- Corrected helper parse_definition() to use "set" or "SET"
  according to capitalizes_types.
(class TableData)
- Newly created with only initialize() and to_s() for now.
(class Schezer)
- Modified execute() to handle command 'data' with single environment
  for now.
- Modified helper parse_table_schema() to use altered TableSchema.new.
